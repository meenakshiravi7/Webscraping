# Webscraping
Simple Web scraping Project using Python

Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Once fetched, then extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else.
We are going to use Books to scrape site. A fictional bookstore that desperately wants to be scraped. Itâ€™s a safe place for beginners learning web scraping and for developers validating their scraping technologies as well. Available at: https://books.toscrape.com/
To do so, we are going to use tools like Python,Requests,BeautifulSoup,Pandas.

Books to scrape site
Outline:
From this site, we are going to grab the following information:

- book titles
- price
- stock availability
- link to get each book
After collecting the information, we are going to store it in a Pandas Data Frame and convert it to CSV file.
